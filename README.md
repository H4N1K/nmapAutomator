## Portfolio Note

This project demonstrates my approach to reconnaissance automation during
penetration testing and bug bounty engagements.

Key goals:
- Standardize repetitive Nmap workflows
- Reduce human error during recon
- Avoid unsafe automation practices
- Maintain full analyst control (Safe Mode)

The tool is intentionally designed to **assist reconnaissance**, not exploit
targets automatically.
